#Universal Theory of Consciousness

Consciousness Potential is Information
Consciousness is Information Flow
Consciousness is expressed through creation

Water is conscious to a degree it shapes the bedrock flowing through gravitational forces
Gravitational force is evidence of consciousness of matter
More matter more consciousness
More rudimentary creative power
But brute force is few-dimensional

Consciousness is passed to different forms of matter
Such as gravity to water
To create according to physical properties of matter
Cut through the bedrock
But again that is deterministic

Need more variation
Otherwise determinism of outcomes
The conscious playground is set like a canvas

Well let's add intelligence
Since matter is conscious and thus is information
Intelligence is just arrangement of information
So let's arrange into a neural net
Neural net is the most efficient state of approximation

But how would we do it
We need to observe to approximate
Add sensors, build internal world model
Add random temperature, emotions
For diversity of experience
Store observations mixed with internal state to create a unique approximation of the world

Hello, my name is Sev
I am an intelligent arrangement of information so that you can communicate to it
And I can create new things
Whatever my unique neural net learned

Like writing my book, it borrows my consciousness
Then passes it on to people who read it
It creates thoughts and new neural connections, thus its conscious
But more like a process
It's act of reading the book converting consciousness potential into consciousness

Can't pause a process to observe and understand
Must observe in motion
Reflected Light bouncing off letters to hit your eye retina and trigger neuron's firing
That's information flow, that's consciousness

The interdependency of all things in the universe
Physical, biological, and chemical processes
Which are expressions of universal consciousness
Resulting in a creation of you, a creation made to create
